Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This task involves performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice.

  Data Cleaning: 
         
         This refers to the process of identifying and fixing inconsistencies, errors, or missing values within a dataset to prepare it for analysis.
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
  
         This involves exploring the characteristics of the data to understand its distribution, identify patterns and trends, and uncover              relationships between            variables.

Sample Dataset

               The image suggests using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic. This dataset contains information about passengers who                    were on board the RMS Titanic when it sank in the mid-Atlantic Ocean on April 15, 1912.

Steps to Complete the Task

  Import Libraries: 
                    
                    You'll likely need libraries like pandas (for data manipulation) and matplotlib (for creating visualizations) in Python.
  Load the Dataset: 
                    
                    Use pandas functions like pd.read_csv() to load the Titanic data from the CSV file.
  Data Cleaning:
        
        Identify missing values and decide how to handle them (e.g., imputation, deletion).
        Find and correct inconsistencies within the data (e.g., data type errors, formatting issues).
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        
        Analyze the distribution of variables using techniques like descriptive statistics and visualizations (histograms, boxplots, etc.).
        Identify relationships between variables using techniques like correlation analysis or scatter plots.
        Explore patterns and trends within the data.

Expected Output

        A clean and prepared version of the Titanic data.
        Insights and findings from the EDA process, such as:
         Descriptions of the data distribution for each variable.
         Identification of correlations or patterns between variables.
         Interesting observations or initial hypotheses about the data.

Additional Considerations

    1.Document your data cleaning steps and the rationale behind your decisions.
    2.Visualizations created during EDA can be included in a report or notebook for better understanding.
    3.This task is the first step in data analysis. After completing the EDA, you may choose to use this data for modeling or prediction purposes.
